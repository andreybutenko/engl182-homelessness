        Addressing the lack of effective housing programs in Seattle would be a huge step forward.
      </p>

      <h2>Effects of gentrification</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond homelessness, affordable housing serves to benefit the entire city.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Seattle becomes more expensive, lower-earning individuals are increasingly pushed out, to the suburbs. This may explain why the Central District – historically a vibrant hotspot of African-American culture – <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/central-districts-shrinking-black-community-wonders-whats-next/" target="_blank">has gone from a 73.4% black population in 1970 to just 18% today</a>. Some lament this loss of diversity and culture and hope for a “new central district” to re-emerge in nearby cities like Kent, but <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/searching-for-a-new-central-district-in-suburban-king-county/" target="_blank">it seems unlikely.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides a loss of diversity, increasing cost of life means increased congestion. Over 400,000 people commute to Seattle each day, and 30% of downtown commutes occur in single-occupant vehicles. Commuting is expensive, time-consuming, and poor for the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Affordable housing would alleviate both of these factors.

      <h2>NIMBY</h2>

      <p>
        Residents in some parts of Seattle are resistant to the ideas of low-income housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        These individuals are known as NIMBYs after the phrase “not in my backyard”. They often live in areas of Seattle such as Ballard or Greenlake which are made up of quiet neighborhoods and child-raising families. Building affordable housing in these areas would mean construction of apartment complexes and an influx of young, single, low-income individuals, going counter to the traditional environment of the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other side of the debate are YIMBYs who favor the construction of low-income housing. These individuals see an increase in density as an opportunity to create a more vibrant community and to create an inclusive, diverse region.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are stereotypes in this debate. YIMBYs are characterized as young, single renters new to Seattle, whereas those on the other side of the debate are typically seen as home-owning families.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact on Homelessness</h2>

      <p>
        The construction of affordable housing will make shelter significantly more attainable for the people who may otherwise be homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some shelters connect companies to labor, providing temp jobs to homeless individuals. This type of work is inconsistent; nobody is guaranteed a job that day. Getting regular jobs elsewhere often requires a mailing address and cleanliness, which is not guaranteed for a person without housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Low-income housing in Seattle would make a big difference in enabling people to work their way out of homelessness.
