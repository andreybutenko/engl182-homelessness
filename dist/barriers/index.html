        Although Seattle's existing approach to homelessness has had some successes, it is ineffective in meeting the <b>current</b> greatest needs of our homeless population: shelter and security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 1980, Seattle has organized an annual One Night Count to get a snapshot of how many people are living without shelter. The count has grown from 2,759 in 2010 to 5,485 in 2017. However, this count doesn’t cover all areas of the city nor count the population in shelters and transitional housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is estimated to be a total of around 10,000 homeless people in Seattle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every year, the city of Seattle spends $40 million on the homelessness issue, and there are a number of nonprofits who operate on donations. A state of emergency has been declared, there are clearly funds available, yet the number of homeless individuals continues to grow. What barriers are keeping services from being used effectively?
      </p>

      <h2>Shelters</h2>
      <p>
        Most of Seattle’s housing programs are centered around short-term housing, between 30 days and 180 days. However, just 8% of adults who stay in emergency shelters find permanent housing, and long-term housing is afflicted with long, long waiting lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an expensive but still ineffective approach.

      <h2>Counseling</h2>
      <p>
        There are a number of shelters in Seattle with counselors available: the Union Gospel Mission, Mary’s Place, and Millionair Club are just a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        Counselors are resources to set plans, identify relevant services, and help navigate the maze of paperwork associated with many homelessness programs. Housing, job trainings, and addiction recovery are just some examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing this relationship can provide great guidance, but requires a degree of trust which is sometimes difficult to accomplish. Furthermore, shelters are often crowded, have long lines, and don’t have the capacity to support individuals with mental illnesses, disabilities, pets, or addictions.
      </p>

      <h2>The Good News: There’s Food</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve had the opportunity to work with the homeless in a number of circumstances, from Outdoor Meal Site by First Hill to Search & Rescue in SoDo. At all of these events, there was always food available to give out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the homeless people of Seattle won’t starve, limited access to vital services such as housing is detrimental.
      </p>
