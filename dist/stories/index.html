      <h2>This is Janice.</h2>

      <p>
        I met Janice at an Outdoor Meal Site event and she surprised me with her message and the apparently simple things she’s lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Janice in an artist. The picture shows her holding her thick stack of work. Her greatest need: a stable and strong backpack to help her safely carry her work. She told me that for many homeless individuals, physical security is a huge need. She has nowhere safe to store her belongings, and has to watch over them constantly. During our conversation, she kept glancing at her bags to make sure they’re still okay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Janice reveals what homelessness is like in Seattle. She’s not starving, she’s not addicted to substances, but she is lacking a place where she can feel safe.

      <h2>This is Jolene.</h2>

      <p>
        I met Jolene asking for money at a street-corner in front of Target.
      </p>
      <p>
        After speaking with her, I learned how selfless she is. Despite living on the streets, she has always put her cat – Shadow – first.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are only a few shelters in Seattle that accept pets, but after being on the waitlist for months, she’s getting ready to move in! Although the shelter provides free pet food, residents are required to have a certain set of items prepared beforehand, including a litter box. That is what Jolene was asking for on the street corner: money for a litter box for her cat Shadow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, she’s living in a tent in some woods. It’s not a safe spot for her, and the racoons are a danger to Shadow.
