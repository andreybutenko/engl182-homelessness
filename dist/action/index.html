      <h2>Engage directly</h2>
      <p>
        A number of Seattle-specific programs exist to support humanification of the homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.samaritan.city/" target="_blank">Samaritan</a> is a mobile app for Seattle citygoers that enables you to learn the stories of homeless individuals as you walk by via push notifications, giving you a chance to have a conversation or give a donation in a cashless, accountable way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Union Gospel Mission’s <a href="https://www.ugm.org/what-we-do/search-rescue/search-rescue/" target="_blank">Search & Rescue</a> program takes volunteers to help deliver food, water, blankets, clothes, and other necessities to homeless individuals throughout Seattle. Volunteers have conversations to get to know the people they’re serving, and help connect them to services they otherwise would not use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.the-block-project.com/home/" target="_blank">The BLOCK Project</a> is an effort to integrate people we consider to be homeless into the community by building small, self-sustaining homes in Seattle backyards.
      </p>

      <h2>Support legislative change</h2>
      <p>
        Mayor Durkan’s first proposed major legislation was <a href="http://homelessness.seattle.gov/mayor-durkan-proposes-building-a-bridge-to-housing-for-all/" target="_blank">“Building a Bridge to Housing for All,”</a> a plan to sell unused city property to fund the construction of affordable housing. She also proposed a $100 million investment to construct 900 affordable housing units across 9 new buildings as well as to maintain existing homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 1999, the <a href="https://downtownseattle.org/programs-and-services/downtown-ambassadors/" target="_blank">Seattle Metropolitan Improvement District (MID)</a> has existed as a program to hire homeless individuals to maintain a safe, friendly, and clean downtown.
